# GraphsPlus
A sample iOS app (incomplete) showcasing my work developing native Swift iOS applications.

Features:
- Line and bar graph creation and visual customization using CoreGraphics/UIKit.
- Persistent storage of graphs, graph styles, and line/bar styles.
- A focus on interesting and unique transitions between views.
- Saving graphs as pictures to the device.
- Built entirely using native Swift code, no Storyboards/Interface Builder.
- Several custom-rolled features including: color-picker, pop-up data entry view, graph views, etc.

Please note this was made for a previous version of iOS/Xcode, I have noticed some issues with the new versions that I still need to fix. Overall the app still functions as expected.
