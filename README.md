# GraphsPlus
*A sample iOS app (incomplete) showcasing my work developing native Swift iOS applications. This was built over 2-3 weeks for a final project in a course I took in college.*

**Features:**

- Line and bar graph creation and visual customization using CoreGraphics/UIKit.
- Persistent storage of graphs, graph styles, and line/bar styles.
- A focus on interesting and unique transitions between views.
- Saving graphs as pictures to the device.
- Built entirely using native Swift code, no Storyboards/Interface Builder.
- Several custom-rolled features including: color-picker, pop-up data entry view, graph views, etc.

**Please note this was made for a previous version of iOS/Xcode, I have noticed the following issues that have been caused by the updates (these may be fixed if I have the time):**

- Keyboard failing to appear on some textfields
- Inability to edit tables
